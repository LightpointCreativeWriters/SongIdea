The idea of the song is about drawing close to God in complete surrender.
To come into the Holy of Holies, His secret place, and there wait on Him.
The cry of this song is that we, as we wait on Him in His secret place, will encounter God, will encounter Holy Spirit and the glory of God's presence in a life altering, real way.
